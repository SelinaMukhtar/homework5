<h3 class="breed">About Border Collie breed</h3>
<p>
    The Border Collie is descended from landrace collies, a type found widely in the British Isles. 
    The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border.
    Mention of the "collie" or "Colley" type first appeared
    toward the end of the 19th century, although the word "collie" is older than this
    and has its origin in the Scots language. It is also thought that the word 'collie' comes from the old
    Celtic word for useful. Many Border Collies today can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.

<p >
    In 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) in the United Kingdom first used
    the term "border collie" to distinguish those dogs registered by the ISDS from the 
    Kennel Club's collie (or Scotch collie, including the rough collie and smooth collie)
    which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different,
    standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different breeds.
